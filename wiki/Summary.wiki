= Introduction =

The goal of the `open-mc13224v` project is to provide an easy way to start development of applications for the Freescale MC13224V chip.

It provides:
 * a set of source files to build basic applications for the chip
 * the rules to build the applications
 * a set of tools that are necessary to interface the chip from a host computer
 * the libraries of the ROM

I started this project with the Freescale MC13224V kits from [http://www.redwirellc.com/store RedWireLLC] and all the targets in this project were tested successfully on this boards.

= Details =

The requirements for this project are:
 * Eclipse 3.2+ installed
 * Python 2.4+
 * gcc for ARM

= Project Structure =
The structure of the project should help locate the files you are looking for:

 * data/ : data files that are not required by the build process
  * flash/ : content of the last page of the flash of the chips that I own
  * rom/ : chip rom content (in different versions if available)
 * docs/ : documentation files
  * registers/ : register description files
   * Makefile : file that generates the header files from the XLS register files
 * libraries/ : library files
 * scripts/ : script files
  * ld/ : link scripts
  * simu/ : simulation scripts (describe the plateform, rom and flash content)
 * src/ : all the source files necessary for the various targets
 * tools/ : set of tools (can be required or not in the build process)

= Documentation =
Most documentation should be found in the wiki pages:
 * RetroEngineering : main page for retro engineering process of the ROM 2.1 and MACPHY.a functions
 * ArmSuite : how to build the ARM free compilation and debugging suite from GNU
