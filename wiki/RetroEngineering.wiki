#summary Portions of code that were retro engineered from the ROM 2.1 and MACPHY.a library.
#labels Phase-Implementation

Elements that were retro engineered from the ROM code:
 * Boot code : RetroBootCode
 * functions published in the ROM interface reference manual:
  * `0x7084 = NVM_SetSVar()` : RetroNvmSetSvar
  * `0x6cb8 = NVM_Detect()` : RetroNvmDetect
 * functions not published in the ROM interface reference manual but that have a published name in the library file LLC.a:
  * `0xe428 = FlashLib_Read()` : RetroFlashLib_Read
  * `0xf97c = InitFromFlash()` : RetroInitFromFlash
 * functions not published in the ROM interface reference manual but that have a published name in the library file MACPHY.a:
  * `0x109b0 = InitializeMac()` : RetroInitializeMac
 * functions not published in the ROM interface reference manual and that have no library name (ROM address is provided and name is invented by me):
  * `0x70a0 = NVM_Command()` : RetroNvmCommand
  * `0x70c4 = NVM_GetBaseAddr()` : RetroNvmGetBaseAddr

Elements that were retro engineered from the MACPHY.a code:
 * `MacPhyInit_Initialize()` : RetroMacPhyInitInitialize
